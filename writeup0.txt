1. What machine did you run on?
  I ran this project on os2.

2. What performance result did you get?
  For 1 thread I got:
    Peak Performance =   986.04 MegaMults/Sec
    Average Performance =   896.36 MegaMults/Sec

  For 4 threads I got:
    Peak Performance =  2168.93 MegaMults/Sec
    Average Performance =  1880.31 MegaMults/Sec
  
3. What was 4-thread-to-1-thread speed up?
  Speed up is 2.199636 for 4-thread-to-1-thread

4.If the 4-thread-to-one-thread speed up is less than 4.0 why do you think it is this way?
  I think the reason the speed up from 4-thread-to-1 thread is less than 4 is because the process is running more quickly. So more work is done quickly.
 
5. What was your Parallel Fraction, Fp?
  Parallel fraction is 0.727172
